## **Prerequisites**

In order to use the save editor you need to get yourself a savefile of your choice (For example public modded saves or your own. The newest edition of the editor also adds an outpost where you find the community favorite saves). If you are not familiar with the process, please try to follow tutorials from our beloved internet. Do not forget that if you use your own PS4 save, you have to use SaveWizard or a SaveBot (for example ProtoBuffers SaveBot) to decrypt your save. Using a SaveBot or a PC save, the .sav file is always compressed. If you are unsure if your save is compressed or not, the editor showcases the data under the name. Check out QnA for for a detailed explanation regarding the topic.

## **Last words**

Please keep in mind that I have a fulltime job and invest my limited free-time for the editor. This means that implementations and fixes may take a while. It's an Open-Source project that is in development process (you could view it as a beta version if you want). So don't expect a finished and perfect product. Contribution and Ideas are always welcome.

With this being said, Good night and good luck fellow Nightrunners!
