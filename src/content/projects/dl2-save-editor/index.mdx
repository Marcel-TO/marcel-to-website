## Tech Stack

This editor uses the _Tauri_ Framework for the application.

- **Tauri Framework**

  TAURI is a framework for building desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript) as the frontend and Rust as the backend. It provides a bridge between the web and native code to create performant and secure desktop applications.

- **Rust**

  Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on performance, safety, and concurrency. It is used as the backend language in this Editor, handling tasks such as file I/O, data manipulation, and other core functionalities.

- **React**

  React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture, making it easy to create interactive and reusable UI components.

</Callout>

- Rust:

  Installation: Before working with TAURI, ensure that Rust is installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the official [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager):

  Installation: TAURI projects typically require Node.js and npm for managing frontend dependencies and building the project. Install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/)

- TAURI CLI:

  Installation: The TAURI Command Line Interface (CLI) is essential for creating, building, and managing TAURI projects. Install it globally using npm:

  ```bash
    npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli
  ```

### To run application

After all prerequisites are fulfilled it is possible to start the application with the following command:

```bash
  npm run tauri dev
```

## Contributers

Currently there are 2 contributers that work hard to increase the experience of Dying Light 2. With the help of Caz`s incredible knowledge of savegamefiles and the coding experience of Marcel, the Editor is not only extremely useful, but has a modern UI with Dying Light 2 themed content. A special thanks to Batang as well. He supported us all the time and played a crucial role for the completion of this editor.
