Welcome to Part II of my [Road to Save Editing | DL2](.) series. After the basics are now covered we can now jump into the interesting and fun parts. I will also show some code examples of types and other relevant parts from my [Save Editor](https://github.com/Marcel-TO/DL2_Save_Editor/) that is written in Rust (the backend/save analysis logic at least). If you are not familiar with this programming language do not be discouraged to continue. It is not required to understand the examples given. With this being said, let us dive in.
